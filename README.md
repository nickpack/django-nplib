django-nplib
============
> My common django guff

### Overview
*Hopefully useful django decorators, middleware and misc utility functions*.

This will eventually contain useful things, but for now I am still decoupling them from projects
and removing everything that makes them tied to their respective projects.

```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'nplib'
)
```

## Changelog
* 20/09/2013 - Initial scrabble together - not much useful stuffs yet.
